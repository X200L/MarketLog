## Usage
Planning robot driven storage facilities can be a long and complicated process and can take from couple hours to multiple days, and the end result of human work can very far from the most optimal design. 
This system can significantly speed up the process and make far more efficient storage designs
System takes building plan(like evacuation plan) as input, user can customize the amount of charging stations, operation area placement and robot size. First step, the system makes a map of zones accessible by robots, then creates a mesh for placing shelves, charging  stations and space for operation area. As the output user gets a map of storage facility with the optimal placement of all required furniture
